# Python-Implementation-of-Checkers-
I developed a Python implementation of the classic game "Checkers", with an emphasis on object-oriented design. 
The game board is an 8x8 grid of alternating red and black squares, and each player begins with 12 pieces on the black squares. 
Players are prompted to enter their names and whether or not to play with mandatory jumps. 
The game logic allows for diagonal movement of one square at a time, with mandatory jumps over opposing pieces when available. 
Once a piece reaches the opposite end of the board, it becomes a queen and gains the ability to move diagonally both forward and backward. 
Players can quit the game at any time by pressing "q". 
To record game data, I implemented a feature that creates a file with the names of both players and the date and time the game started.
Along with details such as player moves, start and end positions, jump results, and any invalid or illegal input.
